# CricketMatchTicketBookingForm
This is an HTML document that appears to be a form for booking cricket match tickets. It includes various input fields and dropdown menus for the user to enter their name, select a date, country, venue, match, and ticket class. The form also has a submit button for booking the tickets.

The document includes a reference to the AngularJS library for data binding and manipulation. It defines an AngularJS module called "myapp" and a controller called "ctrl" to handle the form functionality. The controller initializes the "name" variable and defines a "submit" function that generates a random value and displays an alert with the user's name and country.

There is also a commented-out section of code that appears to be an alternative implementation of the controller, which includes additional fields such as venue, match, and ticket class.

Overall, this code sets up a simple form for cricket match ticket booking using AngularJS for data binding and manipulation.
